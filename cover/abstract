Liquidsoap is a programming language dedicated to programming rock-solid
webradios and videostreams, already used by many radios over the world,
including major ones. It is able to create streams from local and distant media,
as well as live inputs, generate cross-faded transitions between tracks, perform
signal processing such as normalization and compression, broadcast to the world
using Icecast, HLS or YouTube, and much more. Moreover, the unique advantage of
having a full-fledged programming language is that we can cope with all kinds of
interactive situations such as serving as a backend for a website with user
requests, or dynamically generating the contents of the radio. This book covers
the Liquidsoap language, in version 2.0, with a view to stream generation, from
the basics to advanced usecases. No prior knowledge of programming or signal
processing is assumed.
